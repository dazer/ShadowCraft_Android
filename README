This is the repository for the smartphone app version of the project ShadowCraft.
ShadowCraft aims to develop a framework under which theorycrafting (primarily rogue focused) can happen.
This is an independent offspring of the project hatched in ElitistJerks; however, the spirit of the project remains intact. For further information on the inner workings of the aforementioned program reffer to ShadowCraft-Engine and ShadowCraftUI here on GitHub.
